I am D'vontre Coleman, 2006 time magazine person of the year, now working as a freelance web developer in Louisville kentucky. This is my website made with hugo.  I'd love to get into contact with more developers and work together to change the world.  Have a look around, you can see my projects and different methods of getting in contact with me.
