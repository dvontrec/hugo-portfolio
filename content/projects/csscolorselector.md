	<p>This started as a way to prove to myself that I could make a website without the use of any libraries or frameworks. I planned on going to the pool with my friends, for memorial day, but wanted to accomplish something technical so that the day would not be wasted. In my work with D3 I learned to manipulate the DOM when a slider changed.  With this knowledge I create a system that changes the background RGBA to match the values of the Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha sliders.  I focused mostly on the JavaScript so I started using simple bootstrap components to make the design more appealing.  It has changed a lot since the first iteration, and I owe much of the design and structure to <span><a href="https://twitter.com/ejpinky4">Emma Wyman</a></span>, a fellow code Louisville student. We have more plans for this project and if you would like you can watch the repository in <span><a href="https://github.com/dvontrec/CSS-color-selector">Github</a></span> to see it grow</p>
