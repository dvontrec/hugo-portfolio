	<p>I consider Sprinkle of Jeezy to be my baby.  I came up with the idea when I first started programming, after seeing a similar app gain popularity on twitter, but at the time I had no knowledge of how to make it.  After completing <span><a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/100026/">Colt Steele's Web Develeper Bootcamp</a></span> course on Udemy, I knew enough to be dangerous.  The application's home page uses an AJAX call to display randomly selected quotes stored in the backend database.  Guests that access the backend can submit some of their favorite motivational rap quotes, by providing the line, artist, and the song.  This is what I call a MEN(Mongoose, Express, & Node.js) stack application at the moment, but I have many more plans for the future. Some of the features I am working on include linking it to an Alexa skill and making it a mobile application that can send motivation to users daily.
