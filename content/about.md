# Dvontre A Coleman

My name is Dvontre A Coleman.  I am a software Developer based in Louisville, Kentucky.  I have been playing around with different coding languages for the past  3 years, and am currently a developer for a company Called El Toro IP Targeting, on a team that writes primarily in Go.  

The purpose of this site will to be share my thoughts and things that i am learning as a professional Software Developer. I want to be able to write articles that developers of all levels can read and learn / confirm their understanding of topics. I also will sprinkle posts on other topics every once in a while to give an inside look on my life outside of software.
