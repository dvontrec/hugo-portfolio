<div class="description">
	<p>While working on my full stack application development skills, I decided to create a new application using React for a frontend and Google’s Golang as an API server. The result was the CSS Color Creator.  This application allows visitors to register new accounts in order to create colors.  Creating colors allows users to give colors any name they’d like. Logged in users also have the ability to add colors to their favorites, for quick access. The current GitHub repo has docker files included, allowing collaborators to spin up a server locally as long as they have docker installed on their machine.   Future plans are for users to have the ability to create and share pallets.</p>
